The slot machine (HTML5/Javascript/ReactJS- ReduxSaga if you think that it will be usefull)

 

A slot machine is the machine you can see in many casinos where people insert a coin and then there are three wheels spinning with some fruits or symbols inside. In this case, we cannot enter coins

 

The behaviour will be as follows:

The machine has 3 wheels.Each wheel has 4 symbols (strawberry, banana, orange and a monkey). Do not overdo the design. In our case, the machine can show only one symbol per wheel.

The machine starts with the symbols in some random position The machine has a start button. When the user presses it, then the wheels spin (a symbol every, 50ms) If the user doesn’t press start, then the machine does it automatically after 5 seconds If the user doesn’t press stop, the machine stops automatically after 10 seconds (after starting) The machine has a stop button. When the user presses it, then the wheels stop. If all the wheels show the two or more symbols of the same type, then we have a prize!!!. Two identical non-consecutive symbols, the prize is 10 dollars, Two consecutive symbols, then the prize is 20 dollars. The same symbol in all the wheels, the prize is 100 dollars

 

Please, come with a reasonable simple design and a solution. It needs to be properly tested. No need of server side. Just HTML5/Javascript Please push the code to your Github repo otherwise you can send the code back attached to the mail.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
